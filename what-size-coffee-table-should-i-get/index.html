The ideal height for your coffee table will depend on the height of the seat cushions on your sofa.</p><h3>Choosing A Coffee Table At This Height Will Feel Appropriate For The Room And Will Be Functional.</h3><br/><p>The closer the match in height, the better the overall effect. In reality, the type of coffee table or cloth you buy is dependent on your taste and preference.
